This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (usually included with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tumo-Markets/Tumo-MVP.git
    cd Tumo-MVP
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
